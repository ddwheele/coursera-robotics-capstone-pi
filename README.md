# coursera-robotics-capstone-pi
Starter code for the Capstone class of the Coursera UPenn Robotics Specialty

These are the non-empty folders that are in the home directory (/home/pi) of the Raspberry Pi 3 image for that course. I don't own any of this. I am putting these folders on my personal github account because it is a pain to access them if you don't have a Linux computer with root, which I don't, and I want to be able to see them from multiple computers. I'm making them public in case they help some other poor soul who wants to complete that (frustratingly unsupported) class.
